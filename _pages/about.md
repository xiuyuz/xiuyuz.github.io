Hi! I'm a recent Master's graduate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). Before that, I received my Honours Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I've always been fascinated by the unique capabilities of human intelligence and what sets humans apart. I'm interested in researching on developing AI systems that can understand and interact with the world in ways similar to humans, whether through language understanding or physical interaction. I'm particularly interested in:

1. Understanding how different modalities (language, vision, physical interaction) contribute to learning and knowledge representation in AI systems
2. Developing robust methods for knowledge extraction and verification across modalities
3. Creating integrated AI systems that can coordinate multiple capabilities to solve complex tasks safely and effectively
